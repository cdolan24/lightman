# Lightman

Lightman is an artificial agent for track/street cars, running on a Raspberry Pi 5. It connects to the car via OBD-II, provides real-time feedback, manages ECU tunes, and acts as a copilot for optimal performance.

## Features
- Data acquisition from OBD-II and sensors
- Mode-based tune switching (race/street)
- Adaptive tuning recommendations
- Real-time voice assistant feedback
- Manual override controls
- Database for saving tunes and car profiles

## Project Structure
- `data_acquisition/` - OBD-II and sensor data collection
- `tune_management/` - Tune switching, saving, and analysis
- `user_interface/` - Dashboard and app integration
- `voice_assistant/` - Text-to-speech and command handling

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the main application (to be implemented)

## Notes
- Each car has a dedicated database for tunes and logs.
- Designed for extensibility and future features.
